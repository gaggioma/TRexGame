# Python autopilot implementation on ü¶ñ [T-Rex Game](https://trex-runner.com)

## Main purpose
During this summer hollyday, i asked me if was possibile to design and to implement an outopilot ‚úàÔ∏è software to a simple web game in less time as possible. 
For this purpose i have chosen [T-Rex Game](https://trex-runner.com) with the autopilot sw written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).
This game require that t-rex jumps Cactusüåµ before impact on them. 

## Implementation idea
Basically the idea is composed on three steps:

1) [Make a snapshot of current game screen](#game-snapshot)
2) [Define target](#define-target-area)
1) [Simulate keyboard interaction](#keyboard-interaction)

### Game snapshot

### Define target area

### Keyboard interaction
